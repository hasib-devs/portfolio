                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Starting out at the age of 17 I never stopped learning new
                    programming skills and languages. Early I started creating
                    websites for curiosity and just for fun as well. And then I
                    became a good web designer with <strong>HTML</strong>,{" "}
                    <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>jQuery</strong> (jQuery
                    was a hero!). Besides Front-end development, I also explored
                    Backend and other non-web-only technologies. This passion
                    has since lasted and led to my decision to work as a
                    freelance web developer. The success and fun I have in this
                    job are immense and really keep that passion burningly
                    alive.

                        Starting web development on the frontend using modern
                        frameworks like (<strong>ReactJS</strong> and{" "}
                        <strong>VueJS</strong>) I also became more and more of a
                        Backend developer with (Node JS and Laravel) frameworks.
                        I love both worlds nowadays!

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Not only developing, but I'm also very good at deploying
                        web applications into Linux servers. And I have a very
                        good understanding of <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipeline
                        with Github Actions and Gitlab Runner.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Besides Developing and deploying, I explored a little
                        bit of Robotics staff. That's why I bought an Arduino
                        learning kit online. When I feel boring to code then,
                        why not make a Robot!
