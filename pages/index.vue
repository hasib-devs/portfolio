                <p>Starting out at the age of 17 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating websites for curiosity and just for fun as well. And then I became a good web designer with HTML, CSS, and jQuery (jQuery was a hero!). Besides web development, I also explored Python and other non-web-only technologies. This passion has since lasted and led to my decision to work as a freelance web developer. The success and fun I have in this job are immense and really keep that passion burningly alive.</p>
